0.1.0 (before 2017-06-01)

-Reworked a lot of the jobs system:
--Added an error indicator for the npc's when they try to dump things in a full stockpile.
--Added an error indicator to the Farmer/Forester when they are missing essential items (seeds, sapplings).
--Added an error indicator to the Smelter/Baker when there's no fuel to use in the stockpile.
--Added an indicator to the Miner & Forester to show their progress.
--Farmer & Forester will make a snake-like path through their field when doing their job, instead of a saw-like path. (new one is shorter)
--Farmer & Forester will fall back to harvesting when they miss seeds/sapplings to plant.
--Fixed a case where npc's would craft something and immidiately move away instead of wait for the crafting to finish.
--Fixed a case where npc's would be waiting for a cooldown after taking items if they arrive at their jobs very quickly.
--Reduced technical debt a lot to ease improvements.
--Farmer will try to use seeds from his own inventory
--Farmer will dump his current inventory before he starts idling

-Fixed invisible field creation; field created isn't invisible and always the same as the selected area.
-Fixed use-after-free ish error causing lots of chunks to render wrongly.
-Fixed changing blocks not working near a dead npc
-Fixed an issue where removing a job block did not update the colonists/unemployed counts properly
