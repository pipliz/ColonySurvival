-Added key remapping to the gameplay settings menu

--The job is inaccessible due to being blocked (farm with blocks on/above it)
--The job is inaccessible due to job placement (furnace not on the ground)
--The job is unreachable from the current location
-Added audio to placing/removing of plaster blocks
-Removed edibility of straw
-Added text to bread to indicate it heals you.
-Improved mouse control options
--Added invert x-axis toggle
--Added invert y-axis toggle
--Use sliders instead of inputfields.
--Allow locking together x & y axis sliders
--Fixed typo (said sensitivity twice instead of smoothing)
-Limited audio volume to 100% (creates massive distortion above 100%)
-Made audio volume sliders more linear instead of exponential (80% slider is like 80% volume instead of 20%)
