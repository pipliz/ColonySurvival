0.10.1.0 (2024-02-02)

Cosmetic Water Update: transparency, no longer looks like meringues
Also adjusted water effect volumes and swimming mechanics a bit

Other changes;
- Added a "low" and "medium" Torch Quality setting. These render the torch lighting at reduced resolution; should help a lot with minimum-spec gaming.
- Minor tweak to day cycle lighting (and moved some of the config into a .png in gamedata/textures/materials/lighting.png)
- Fix ambient lighting disappearing entirely just after sunset and before sunrise for ~30 seconds each

0.10.1.1 & 0.10.1.2 (2024-02-02)

Quick fix to a performance/rendering issue caused by lacking GPU support for a certain texture format

0.10.1.3 (2024-02-08)

- Fix some (older) items requiring a solid base block below not being auto-removed when the block below is removed
- Fix lantern being glow-in-the-dark for the non-emissive parts
- Add lantern (roof, side, floor) colliders
- Removed eye adaptation setting (it has done very little for a while now)
- Further tweaked some lighting settings
- Minor french locale changes
- Allow placing blocks against the elevator shaft blocks
- Fix the elevator clipping you into the ground if you take it going down directly into the ground from a station
- Fix going forward/back not working anymore with the F9 point-focus-orbiting dev tool
- Fix being unable to place the alchemist table in one of the directions
- Fix monsters missing ambient lighting (?? how long has this been a thing)
- Fix banner safe zone visualisation marking a safe block as unsafe when that area is above the banner

0.10.1.4 (2024-02-13)

- Holding the jump button while in an evator or on rail will make it skip stations

0.10.1.5 (2024-02-14)

- Fix a logic bug where NPC position updates could sometimes be double queued (should have no visible difference)
- Fix a logic bug where NPC logic updates would sometimes not queue; they would freeze when they wanted to recalculate their path
- Punching unemployed colonists idling around the banner will make them move most of the time (should help when they are in the way)
- Mods: send sprint & crouch input states to server-based transport (like the rail, elevator, glider)

0.10.1.6 (2024-02-xx)

- Add a feature that dims torches a little when outside in daylight
- Add/tweak height based fog, mostly around sunrise
- Rename light scattering to fog in the video settings menu for clarity
