0.3.1 (2017-**-**)
-Added 3 new researches, to unlock the tailor, technologist and life science bags.

-Fixed an issue with recipe limits being shared for all recipes with the same outcome (i.e, taiga logs -> planks & temperate logs -> planks)
-Updated Unity version from 5.6.2f1 to 5.6.3p2
--Fixes various issues
--Reduced client RAM use by 40 MB
-Fixed errors upon loading .obj without a uv channel (use default vertex / uv when out of range)
-Fixed an issue where the savegames server.json file is made before the working directory is fixed
-Fixed an issue where players would connect longer/deeper than desired when they are refused for any reason
-Fixed a bug in the pathfinding precalculation where it may fail to mark some positions as traversable

-Optimized the chunk updater, significantly reducing the performance cost of active chunks
--Active chunks are checked a lot less when they're active due to a banner
--Autosaving checks are now seperate from unloading checks
-Optimized the AI path precalculation - it takes about 40% of the time it used to (lowered cpu load of server upon moving / loading)
-Added compression to the servers' voxel data per chunk (saves up to 50%-ish of RAM)
-Added "name" keys to modInfo.json
-Added "compatibleversions" key to modInfo.json, to indicate supported versions of the mod
-Allow torches to be added to any block
-Added jsonnode.TryGetAsOrDefault - returns found value if it exists, default if it doesn't.
-Added InventoryItem(string) constructor
-Changed various name, methods and classes related to Recipes to support adding recipes through researchables
--Recipes now have a unique name and default limit per recipe
--Recipes can now be 'optional', which have to be unlocked through code ingame.
-Serialize the WorldSettings after the default inventory / stockpile contents are added upon first launch (instead of before those are added)
