0.3.1 (2017-**-**)
-Added 3 new researches, to unlock the tailor, technologist and life science bags.

-Fixed colonists only eating from bread if there's enough of it. Now it'll balance between food types (trying to keep total food value equal between stacks)
-Fixed an issue with recipe limits being shared for all recipes with the same outcome (i.e, taiga logs -> planks & temperate logs -> planks)
-Fixed an issue where the game would not properly use it's gamedata directory if launched from with a non-standard working directory
-Fixed an issue where players would connect longer/deeper than desired when they are refused for any reason
-Fixed a bug in the pathfinding precalculation where it may fail to mark some positions as traversable
-Updated Unity version from 5.6.2f1 to 5.6.3p2 fixing various issues (& a 40 MB memory leak)
-Fixed an issue with the client not properly receiving the disconnect packet when kicked
-Fixed some of the issues with timeouts in the connection screen, by vastly improving the connecting scene logic

-Moved nearly all gamedata files to the server, to allow for a better modded server experience. (no need for clients to install files)
--This includes audio, localization, meshes, textures, icons, npc textures, water textures
-Optimized the chunk updater, significantly reducing the performance cost of active chunks
--Active chunks are checked a lot less when they're active due to a banner
--Autosaving checks are now seperate from unloading checks
-Optimized the AI path precalculation - it takes about 40% of the time it used to (lowered cpu load of server upon moving / loading)
-Added compression to the servers' voxel data per chunk (saves up to 50%-ish of RAM)
-Optimized torch rendering; reduced time to render for torches by 33-90% depending on scenario. Improves fps in tests by between 0 & ~20%

-Tweaked scroll sensitivity for the stockpile, crafting menu, science menu and crafting limits menu

-Very large list of internal / mod related changes. Haven't kept it up to date.
