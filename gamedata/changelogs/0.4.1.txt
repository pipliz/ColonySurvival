0.4.1 (2017-11-*)

Added configurable job crafting priorities; by default ammunition types are high priority, ingredients medium and the rest low priority.
Added "/lootall [amount]" command, to loot most notable blocks.
Guards now prioritize zombies with health closer to their max damage (slingers shoot weak ones, muskets strong ones), in addition to shooting the closest one.
Improve usability of the crafting limits interface: Limit shown is now the actual limit of items made, not recipes made. Also shows missing ingredients in red, and the amount currently in the stockpile.
Added a 3x damage modifier if punching with an iron sword
Usage of "/setflight" is now stored (no need to type it every time)
To eliminate some confusion, unused stockpile slots (the white ones) above 60 (the initial ones) will be removed when unused

Possibly fix an issue where colonists would randomly fail to find a path once (but succeed on repeated attempts)
Increase path complexity limit because increased pathfinding performance allows it
Fixed an issue where others' banners would be less safe for you then for them (the half-half colored block from other banners was not safe)
Changed npc code to update less often (more performant)
Slightly improved performance from lots of npc progress indicators
Fixed an issue causing the server to re-save all player data despite most of it being untouched
Improved server quitting speed by multithreading a part of it
Improved server loading speed by multithreading a part of it
Fix siege mode being activated while loading a world

API/mod related stuff:
Refactored NPC.JobTracker a bit to make it more accessible
Removed implicit InventoryItem <-> JSONNode casting operators
Added TotalHealth, CurrentHealth and MovementSpeed to IMonster
MonsterTracker.Find now takes a preferedHealth argument, for selecting monsters close to that health
Opened up Inventory class for more mod use. Do note that client side changes overwrite the inventory (it's not intended for server side changes yet)
Removed BlockJobBase.TimeBetweenJobs, use state.OverrideCooldown in the OnNPCDoJob / OnNPCAtStockpile methods
Removed BlockJobBase.OnNPCDoJob / OnNPCDoStockpile, use OnNPCAtJob / OnNPCAtStockpile instead. The 'wrapper' method is no longer needed due to the TimeBetweenJobs change
Added CraftingJobBase.CraftingCooldown (get/set), for per-job changes to crafting times. Implemented as a static field per existing job
Changed MonsterSpawner.TryGetSpawnLocation to return an ESpawnResult (to check for 'not yet loaded' areas and not trigger siege mode for it)
