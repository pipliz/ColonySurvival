0.4.5 (2017-12-01)

-Hide the bow & bowstring recipes from the workbench job until you've researched the bronze anvil
-Hide linseedoil, coated planks and adobe from the workbench job until you've researched flax farming
-Changed black planks recipe to use charcoal instead of coal ore

-Added a basic autosave for non-block data (players, jobs etc), every 5 minutes by default.
-Added a '/tps' command to get the ticks per second the server is running at (to see if it's lagging badly, gives avg fps over 10 seconds - optimal is ~50)
-Changed saving of JSON files to prevent file corruption if the game crashes during saving (similar to regions change a few patches back).
-Fixed npc's sometimes deciding to stand at the side of a block that isn't the closest to them
-Fixed an issue with water spreading (it would spread anyway even after you filled a water block)
-Fix an issue where changing multiple blocks at the same time could cause issues for pathfinding
-Possibly fix an issue with the forester being unable to find a path
-Added a configuration option to turn off a torch optimization for compatibility reasons
|  set 'TorchClosePassOptimizationCount' in gamedata/savegames/client.json to 1 to fix these issues. Default is 32
|  the setting changes how many 'close' torches are rendered together
|  you may have to launch the game once for the setting to appear
-The game no longer keeps the area around a banner loaded if there's no colonists associated with the colony
-Tweaked block autosaving to not save everything at once every 16 seconds but every few minutes instead
-Sorted all translation keys in the locale files

Modding changes:
-Added OnAutoSaveWorld callback
-Added player.IDString, which is just a cached version of player.ID.ToString()
-Made Colony.collection public
-Changed JSONNode internals to use a sorted list instead of a dictionary
-Fixed a problem with using sortedList.AddOverride or setting through the indexer
-Allow multiple [ModCallback] attributes on 1 method, though they'll all use the same providesfor/dependson
