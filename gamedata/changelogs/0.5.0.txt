0.5.0 (2017-12-22)

Welcome to the Christmas Update; Colony Survival 0.5.0

The update contains five new jobs: a dyer, a stonemason and three herb farmers.  It also contains colored lanterns! The stonemason crafts new building materials and the dyer can use the new herbs to paint them in many different colors. The dyer can also change lanterns to emit different colors of light. 

To make sure players realize that they unlock bow guards, we've added a new research called 'Archery'. If you've already unlocked Military Science Bags, it should be instantly unlocked! 

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

| Alkanet farmer, Hollyhock farmer, Wolfsbane farmer

-Added a new (colored) type of planks
-Added (colored) cobble stone

-Added Archery research, that unlocks the bow & bow guard (instead of the bronze anvil doing it)

-Added support for colored variants of blocks (with a mask texture to determine what part to color)
-Added support for importing .ply files with vertex colors
-Added an example texture pack mod (/gamedata/mods/Examples/TexturePack/)
-Substantially simplified modding existing game files

-Added a workaround that'll automatically remove block jobs if they glitched out (tracked jobs but no block anymore)
-The farmers will now check if their crops are actually going to grow, so if it broke (due to savegame issues) they'll fix it automatically
-Fixed glitchy selection graphics when areas neighboured eachother
-Doubled charcoal production
-Fixed an issue blowing up the server after X amount of time (really, it should be fixed now :( )
-Science bag basic research now requires linen bags
-Fixed a few blocks having incorrect normal mapping
-Changed emissive / mask textures to be in linear space instead of gamma space
-Changed height / smoothness / specularity textures to be in linear space instead of gamma space
-Limit time spend spawning zombies per server tick; 50 ms cap per tick default (server.json setting, Zombies -> MSPerTick)
-Tweaked lighting brightness a bit if eye adaptation is disabled
-Tweaked TAA settings to remove some artifacts (could see movement through blocks). Should look less blurry overall as well.
-Changed internal mesh structure, ever so slightly faster rendering + (V)RAM savings:
| Removed about 12 bytes / vertex by compressing some data, saving about 45 MB RAM / ~18 MB VRAM in a benchmark.
-Ported various blocks with solid colors to the new color system
-Sorted the types by alphabet in types.json & texturemapping.json
-Collapsed some nodes of types.json to lower size/line count
-Fixed snow, sand and cherry blossom not sorting in the stockpile

Modding changes:
-Changed the torches customData fields from "red", "green", "blue" integers to a "color" : "#ffffff" (hex color code) field
-Fixed normal maps requiring you to flip the red channel to work properly
-Overhauled various things in code:
| Fully replaced the old UpdatableBlocks code with a combination of the Server.GrowableBlocks and Pipliz.Mods.APIProvider.GrowableBlocks namespaces (base implementation)
| Fully replaced the old AreaJobs code with a combination of the AreaJobTracker and Pipliz.Mods.APIProvider.AreaJobs namespace (base implementation)
| Merged the BaseResearch and BlockNPCs code into a "BaseGame" mod.
| Changed namespaces of most of the APIProvider / BaseGame mods - went from "Pipliz.APIProvider" to "Pipliz.Mods.APIProvider" mostly.
-Added ability to (through code):
| Change the npc textures; NPCTypeNormalSettings has some static fields for it
| Change the water textures; ItemTypesServer.Texture_Water_* are static fields for it
-Changed modinfo.json format:
| Removed the root object node with the "assemblies" key. Root node is now the inner array used previously
| Changed compatibleversions array to use "x.x.x" as version instead of major/minor/build objects
| Added a mod version field to each mod description
| Renamed "path" key to "dllpath"
-Added the following possible keys to a mod description in modinfo.json's. Each loads replacement files from the set directory if they exist.
| "overrideAlbedoFolder"
| "overrideEmissiveFolder"
| "overrideHeightFolder"
| "overrideNormalFolder"
| "overrideMeshesFolder"
| "overrideIconFolder"
| "overrideNPCFolder"
| "overrideWaterFolder"
| "overrideAudioFolder"
-Changed ModLoader.ModAssembly class into ModLoader.ModDescription.
| Assemblies are optional
| Access to the description JSON
-Added ModLoader.AddFolderRedirection() and ModLoader.RedirectFile().
| Used to implement the overrideFolder keys above. Call RedirectFile with a path to a file and it may return the 'replaced' path.
-Renamed TimeCycle.NightLengthLeft to TimeCycle.TimeTillSunRise
-Added TimeCycle.TimeTillSunSet

0.5.0 post-release
-Various fixes to make the farmers / forester work
-More fixes for above -.-

2017/12/31 - another hotfix, to fix slowly crashing servers depending on how many growable blocks there are (don't ask)
