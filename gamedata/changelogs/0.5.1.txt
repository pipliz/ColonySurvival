0.5.1 (2017-01-**)

-Added back the old red & black planks ("coated" planks from the dyer)

-Updated de-DE, es-ES, fr-FR, ja-JP and ru-RU locales for 0.5 coverage (credits to contributors of https://github.com/pipliz/ColonySurvival )
-Updated ko-KR, pt-BR locales for 0.5 coverage (credits to those who emailed them)
-Enable tcp nodelay for client<->server singleplayer connections
-Wait for the previous autosave to complete before starting a new one (rare edge case)
-Updated unity from 5.6.4p2 to 5.6.4p4
-Fixed silver+crystal recipe to continue being crafted until both limits are reached (instead of stopping if one of them reaches it)

Modding changes:
-Probably fixed errors that happened if a version wasn't exactly in the format x.x.x (it'll fill in missing ones with 0)
