0.5.2 (2017-01-19)

-Added "stair blocks" in the form of 5 colored quarter blocks.
-Changed how torches/lanterns are managed, to significantly reduce any lag spikes associated with them during block updates
| Also fixes the longer lag spike upon rendering the first torch/lantern
-Fixed the issue with 'time traveling' where the time would rapidly change under server load
-Fixed an issue with the stoneblock normal map

-Added 2 new options to the gamedata/savegames/client.json file:
| "TorchUpdatesPerFrameMax" - how many torches can update per frame. Default is 5.
| "AutoClimbStepSize" - how big the step size is one can autoclimb onto. Default is 0.5 - should be an option in the future to set it to 1 (for autoclimbing full blocks)

Modding changes
-Added "boxColliders" key to item types, see new blocks included in the update
-VoxelRayCastHit now includes the box bounds the ray hit (if it hit a block). Includes for PlayerClickedData
-Added a bool at the end of the NPCUpdate package sent to a client, to indicate whether or not to compensate for standing on a box collider block or not (false -> compensate)
-Replaced ReceiveTimeData client package with a ReceiveHeartBeat
