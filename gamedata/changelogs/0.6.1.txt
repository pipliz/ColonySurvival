0.6.1 (2018-04-xx)

-Overhauled the server browser menu
| Added password support
| Show total colonist count on a server
| Allow sorting by ping, player count, version and server name
| Allow filtering for empty / full / compatible
| Fixed the "view players" option per server not working
| Show whether or not a server is modded, and which mods are running

-Stockpile now keeps tiles when they reach 0, to prevent the tiles from moving about a lot
-Fixed an issue where if the server crashed you could have people trying to go to invisible jobs; they self-destruct now
-Improved the use of timestamping to track things; should speed up various parts of the game (server and client)
-Fixed the forester sometimes not setting a cooldown in its job
-The indicator icon shown above a crafter when a recipe with multiple results is crafted is now chosen weighted by crafted quantities
-Some speedup to loading the server (and thus loading singleplayer worlds) by multithreading the loading of some types of game files

Modding changes:
-Added jsonFiles property to modInfo.json files
--Allows loading various types (player recipes, types, texturemapping, npc recipes) with no code involved
--See modinfo.txt help file
-Added support for relative paths in types and texturemapping json files
-Changed texturemapping json file to include settings (default textures, default folders to look for files, default extension)
-Added AddItemTypes modcallback type; identical to AfterAddingBaseTypes, but runs before it (it's where the json types are added)
-Log a warning when a mesh file contains more than 65000 vertices
-Added a modinfo.txt help file to the gamedata/help/ folder
-Removed RotatedCraftingJobBase. Instead use the IsValidWorldType virtual method described below
-Added BlockJobBase.worldType, BlockJobBase.worldTypeChecked fields.
-Added BlockJobBase.CheckWorldType() & BlockJobBase.IsValidWorldType(type)
--The idea is that at 'critical' points the world type will be sampled once, and passed into IsValidWorldType(type). If that returns false, the job self-destructs.
--worldType can be used with a GetJobLocation override to replicate RotatedCraftingJobBase functionality
-Added Time.SecondsSinceStartDoubleThisFrame
-Added Time.MillisecondsSinceStartThisFrame
-- same as the non-ThisFrame one, but is set once every frame (in an UpdateStart callback) to prevent excessive timestamping calls
-Removed some callback instances:
--pipliz.server.loadtexturemappingfile
| default files are now loaded through the basegame modinfo.json instead
--pipliz.apiprovider.registerrecipes
| default npc recipes are now loaded through the basegame modinfo.json instead (pipliz.server.recipenpcload)
-Removed IRecipeLimitsProvider from the APIProvider; use the modinfo.json way of loading npc recipes instead
