0.7.0.0 (2018-xx-xx)

Known issues:
-Client crashes when alt+f4'd, on directX ingame and with Eye Adaptation enabled (workaround in place for a proper quite)
-Input issues on Ubuntu (likely)
-Projectiles slow

-0.7.0 does not load pre-0.7.0 worlds
-Removed 32-bit support
-Update Unity3D version from 5.6.5p3 to 2017.4.6f1
-Updated .NET runtime from 3.5 to 4.6
-Updated Open.NAT library version - now has its own seperate managed dll
-Updated Steamworks.NET version - now has its own seperate managed dll
-Updated post processing stack code to a newer version (various fixes/improvements)
-Removed ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib dependency
-Signficantly changed savegame format
| Now uses a lot less files and is a lot more robust
-Fixed some logic issues which caused inconsistent autosaving of blocks
-Generated chunks are not automatically saved anymore - only chunks that are actually edited are. Increases CPU load on subsequent world loads, but reduces world size very much.
-Fixed a very silly mistake that slowed down writing json files by 7+ times

Modding changes
- settings/serverperclient.json
| Removed "ColonistMovementSpeed" and "StandardMonsterMovementSpeed" - they were unused
- settings/server.json
| Removed "MovementSpeed" from server.json - unused
| Removed 5 settings related to Region saving - removed (no more regions)
-Removed TAttribute[] Pipliz.Extensions.GetCustomAttributes<TAttribute> (this MemberInfo type, bool inherit) - builtin .NET now
-Removed bool Pipliz.Extensions.TryGetCustomAttributes<TAttribute> (this MemberInfo type, bool inherit, out TAttribute[] result) - builtin .NET now
-Removed Pipliz.WeakReference<T> - builtin .NET now
-Removed the following classes from Pipliz.Collections.Threadsafe, use builtin classes from System.Collections.Concurrent or manual locking:
| ThreadedList<T>, ThreadedHashSet<T>, ThreadedDictionary<T, K>
-Updated/Improved/Added the following classes frm Pipliz.Collections.Threadsafe:
| ThreadedQueue<T>, ThreadedStack<T>
-Renamed World.ChunkCount to World.CalculateCount() - to reflect the increased complexity of its
-Removed ActiveChunks statistic (calculating it is too slow now)
-Changed saving/loading callbacks (regions don't exist anymore):
| Removed OnSavedChunkToRegion, OnLoadedRegionFromDisk, OnLoadedChunkFromRegion, OnSavedRegionToDisk
| OnSavedChunkToRegion has become OnSavedChunk
| OnLoadedChunkFromRegion has become OnLoadedChunk
-Removed FileSaver.FileCompression class - was unused
-Deleted WorldConverter mod (world data changed too much)
-Removed Chunk.ShouldAutoSave {get;} - responsibility moved to the SaveManager
-Removed ChunkUpdating.AddDirty(chunk) - responsibility moved to the SaveManager
-Renamed Chunk.GetBytes() to Chunk.GetNetworkPacket() to better indicate it's use
-Removed Chunk.IChunkData methods CompressNetwork & GetCompressedDisk - they're functions on the chunk now
-Added Chunk.IChunkData.IsAir - quick way of knowing if a chunk is full air or not
-Added Chunk.ForeachData - for efficient processing of chunks in their compressed form
-Added Chunk.ForeachDataReplace - for efficiently replacing one type of block with another. Does not send updates to clients, does not trigger AI recalculations, does not register changes for complex types, beware.
-You can now send full chunk updates to clients - like Players.SendToNearbyDrawDistance(position, chunk.GetNetworkPacket(), 200000); with the chunk locked for reading
-Added ItemTypes.GetType(string) (basically short for ItemTypes.GetType(ItemTypes.IndexLookup.GetType(string)) )
-Added an EChunkLoadedSource enum to the OnShouldKeepChunkLoaded callback
-Removed crates list from stockpiles, deleted StockpileBlock and StockpileBlockTracker.
| Colony.GetClosestStockpileCrate is still there, using ServerManager.BlockEntities.CrateTracker underneath
-Removed BedBlock & BedBlockTracker
| Functionality moved to ServerManager.BlockEntities.BedTracker & BedTracker.Bed
-Removed log/leaves parenttype - log/leaves behaviour is now applied through customData attachBehaviour - see gamedata/help/types.txt
-Removed GrowableBlocks code. Replaced by BlockEntities & the APIProvider abstract base class "BaseGrowableBlockDefinition". See BaseGame growable blocks (alkanet etc) for how to use it
