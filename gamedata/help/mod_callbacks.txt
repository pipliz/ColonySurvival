These callbacks are called in order of placement here:

void OnAssemblyLoaded (string p)
Called directly upon discovering a method with this attribute; passes the assemblies path as a parameter. Can't use providesfor/dependson here.
Builtin callback uses:
  pipliz.blocknpcs.assemblyload

    Checks the commandline arguments for "+logto {port}", and if found, tries to connect to said port via tcp

The following 'paragraph' callbacks are all called from the filesaver thread. Be careful with multithreading, a significant portion of the game is not threadsafe.
