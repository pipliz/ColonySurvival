The current builtin mods:
-Pipliz/APIProvider
--Provides base classes/interfaces/managers for handling jobs definition
--Provides a basic recipe manager
--Provides a researchable manager/loader
-Pipliz/BaseGame
--Uses API's provided by Pipliz/APIProvider to define nearly all jobs and 'smart' blocks, and the base games' researches.
-Pipliz/WorldConverter
--When enabled provides an interface on the server that allows moving a worlds' region files from one itemtypetable to another
-Pipliz/colonyserverwrapper/colonyserverwrapperdll
--When the game is start with +logto {port}, this mod will try and connect the logging output / chat input to a tcp socket on that port on the local host.

To get an idea of how to receive callbacks etc, take a look at the included mod sources.
For mod development I'd recommend the debug and/or development branches of the game, as those are build as unity development builds.
This should also allow connecting the unity profiler after installing unity, to log/check performance much more accurately than the included graphs. 


For a detailed list of callbacks and their builtin uses, see mod_callbacks.txt

Adding types to the game

	Use the following attribute:
	[ModLoader.ModCallback(ModLoader.EModCallbackType.AfterAddingBaseTypes, "INSERT_UNIQUE_KEY")]
	See the callback description in mod_callbacks.txt
	You can add your type to the dictionary passed in the argument. The key should be the item name.
	The ushort index of the created type can later be found from ItemTypes.IndexLookup.GetIndex
	The type itself can later be found in ItemTypes.GetType
	
Adding audio to the game

	Use the following attributes:
	[ModLoader.ModCallback(ModLoader.EModCallbackType.AfterSelectedWorld, "INSERT_UNIQUE_KEY")]
	[ModLoader.ModCallbackDependsOn("pipliz.server.registeraudiofiles")]
	[ModLoader.ModCallbackProvidesFor("pipliz.server.loadaudiofiles")]
	See the callback description in mod_callbacks.txt
	
	To add custom audio files, they have to be registered in the gamedata/audio/audioFiles.json file.
	This json file is available through code in the above callback, at ItemTypesServer.AudioFilesJSON
	See the json file on disk for the format to follow.
	In later callbacks you can use ServerManager.SendAudio to play sounds on the client.
	
Adding localization to the game

	Use the following attributes:
	[ModLoader.ModCallback(ModLoader.EModCallbackType.AfterWorldLoad, "INSERT_UNIQUE_KEY")]
	[ModLoader.ModCallbackDependsOn("pipliz.server.localization.waitforloading")]
	[ModLoader.ModCallbackProvidesFor("pipliz.server.localization.convert")]
	See the callback description in mod_callbacks.txt
	
	Same story as with audio; JSON files available in a callback to edit.
	They're available at Server.Localization.Localization.LoadedTranslation
	the dictionary is keyed by the locale (like "en-US")
	
Adding meshes to the game

	Simply place it in a folder somewhere, and reference it in the type descriptio; "mesh" : "path/to/file.obj"
	File formats supported:
		.obj, with UV mapping.
		.ply, with UV mapping or vertex colors or both
	Normals/tangents should not be included in the file, they are recalculate upon import.
	All faces should be triangulated (i.e, no 4+-vertex-faces)
	If the exporter has a direction option, set y+ = up, and z- = forward
	
Adding textures to the game

	Textures work similar to meshes, but with an intermediate step.
	The textures used by a type are not in types.json, but in texturemapping.json.
	A type will reference to the texturemapping type for its textures.
	
	Use the following attributes:
	[ModLoader.ModCallback(ModLoader.EModCallbackType.AfterSelectedWorld, "INSERT_UNIQUE_KEY")]
	[ModLoader.ModCallbackProvidesFor("pipliz.server.registertexturemappingtextures")]
	See the callback description in mod_callbacks.txt
	
	ItemTypesServer.TextureMappings is the dictionary to use. It's keyed by the unique material name.
	The string constructor will use the paths provided and fallback to error/neutral colored textures if not used.
	The fields from the TextureMapping struct should be the full paths to the textures relative to the game root directory.
	
Adding player crafting recipes to the game

	Create a new Recipe in code.
	If you want it to be unlockable, mark the recipe as isOptional in the constructor.
	Use RecipePlayer.AddOptionalRecipe(recipe). To make it available later, call RecipePlayer.UnlockOptionalRecipe
	If it's always usable, use RecipePlayer.AddDefaultRecipe(recipe)
	
	There's no specific callback to use for this, but item types should be registered (so AfterItemTypesDefined and later)
	
Adding job crafting recipes to the game

	Create a new Recipe in code.
	If you want it to be unlockable, mark the recipe as isOptional in the constructor.
	defaultLimit is the default limit (amount of times to craft this, not amount of results to craft)
	defaultPriority is the default priority; -100, 0 or 100 are the ones a player can set through the interface
	
	To be unlockable: Use RecipeStorage.AddOptionalLimitTypeRecipe
	To unlock it later: Use RecipeStorage.GetPlayerStorage.SetRecipeAvailability
	To be unlocked by default: Use RecipeStorage.AddDefaultLimitTypeRecipe
	"identifier" / "limitType" in these methods is the npc type that'll craft the recipe - like pipliz.crafter for the workbench guy.
	
	There's no specific callback to use for this, but item types should be registered (so AfterItemTypesDefined and later)
