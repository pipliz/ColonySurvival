The current builtin mods:
-Pipliz/BlockNPCs
--Uses API's provided by Pipliz/APIProvider to define the furnace, grinder, mint, oven, quiver, shop and workbench.
-Pipliz/APIProvider
--Provides base classes/interfaces/managers for handling jobs definition
--Provides a basic recipe manager

To get an idea of how to receive callbacks etc, take a look at the included mod sources.
For mod development I'd recommend the debug and/or development branches of the game, as those are build as unity development builds.
This should also allow connecting the unity profiler after installing unity, to log/check performance much more accurately than the included graphs. 
Rest of this document is mostly a description of the various callbacks


These callbacks are called in order of placement here:

void OnAssemblyLoaded (string p)
-Called directly upon discovering a method with this attribute; passes the assemblies path as a parameter.

void AfterStartup ()
-Called at the end of the startup code, first real callback. Use for basic initialization.

void AfterSelectedWorld ()
-First callback after the world to load has been determined.
-The place to call ItemTypesServer.Register* methods

void AfterDefiningNPCTypes ()
-After the game has defined its default npc types.
-Use NPC.NPCType settings methods here to register/change npc types.

void AfterAddingBaseTypes ()
-ItemTypes.IndexLookup loaded, The place to call ItemTypes.AddRawType() to add types.json nodes.

void AfterItemTypesDefined ()
-Do things that require all itemtypes to be defined here. Loading recipes etc.

void AfterItemTypesServer ()
-Place to override ItemTypesServer.Register* things from the base game.

void AfterWorldLoad ()
-After all misc data is loaded (structures, npc's, player data, lots)

void AfterNetworkSetup ()
-After the NetworkWrapper class is loaded, ready to send data. Can take a few seconds for steam servers - it's after port forwarding etc is done on another thread.


These callbacks are done at various times:

void OnUpdateStart ()
-Start of Unity's Update loop, before anything is called (except for quitting mechanisms).

void OnUpdate ()
-Just after OnUpdateStart, after the ThreadManager did main thread delegates. Probably the place to put the bulk of per-frame-updates.

void OnUpdateEnd ()
-Just before the end of the update loop, after OnUpdate (after all relevant gamecode)

void OnGUI ()
-Unity's legacy GUI loop - use UnityEngine.GUI calls here to implement some basic interface things (on the server)

void FixedUpdate ()
-Unity's FixedUpdate loop

void LateUpdate ()
-Unity's LateUpdate loop (comes after Update and some unity internal things)

void OnApplicationFocus (bool b)
-Unity's OnApplicationFocus method.

void OnApplicationPause (bool b)
-Unity's OnApplicationPause method (probably unused, as the game does not have proper support for pausing, but hey here is an entry)

void OnPlayerConnectedEarly (Player p)
-Player {p} connected to the server. Very early call, player will probably ignore most messages here.

void OnPlayerConnectedLate (Player p)
-Player {p} connected to the server. Messages sent here will be received after the client is done loading. Allows for chat messages.

void OnPlayerDisconnected (Player p)
-Player {p} was disconnected.

void OnPlayerMoved (Player p)
-Player {p} sent an updated position. Called approx 6 times per second per player. New position/rotation is set in {p}.

bool OnTryChangeBlockUser (ModLoader.OnTryChangeBlockUserData d)
-Player {d.requestedBy} requested a block change from {d.typeNow} to {d.typeNew} at {d.position}.
-Return true if you allow this change
-Return false if you disallow this change

void OnLoadingPlayer (JSONNode n, Player p)
-Player {p} was loaded with json file {n}.

void OnSavingPlayer (JSONNode n, Player p)
-Player {p} is being saved into json file {n}.

void OnQuitEarly ()
-General.Application.OnQuit @ -200, called before most other on quit actions

void OnQuit ()
-General.Application.OnQuit @ 0, after connected players are disconnected, various things saving at the same time

void OnQuitLate ()
-General.Application.OnQuit @ 100, after most quit actions happened

void OnResearchableCompleted (Server.Science.IResearchable res)
-Called upon completion of a researchable

The following 'paragraph' callbacks are all called from the filesaver thread. Be careful with multithreading, a significant portion of the game is not threadsafe.

void OnSavedRegionToDisk ()
-A region is saved to the disk

void OnLoadedRegionFromDisk ()
-A region is loaded from the disk.

void OnSavedChunkToRegion ()
-A chunk is saved to the region. The chunk is locked for reading data.

void OnLoadedChunkFromRegion ()
-A chunk is filled from a region in memory. The chunk is locked for writing data.


I apologize for the very inconsistent namespacing and general code quality. Part of the project is up to 2-3 years old, where I was even more of a beginner programmer.
I've gone through some phases & every phase thought "oh but this is the way it should be done", and suddenly every part of the game is written in a different style. But such is life at the beginning.
There's also random dead code / unused-semi-build features, because of shifting priorities.
