How to enable the Example dll;
-Set "enabled" : true in the modInfo.json
-Launch the server

To build the Example dll;
-Create a new project in visual studio or some other
-Change .NET framework to 3.5
-Move ExampleClass.cs into it (or create it over it, whichever works)
-Add references to "colonyserver_Data\managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll", and probably UnityEngine.dll (.ui) from the same folder.
-Build it
-Move the built dll to the desired locations (\mods\Pipliz\Example\Example.dll)
-Set "enabled" : true in the modInfo.json
-Launch the server
-It hopefully works

The game searches for all "modInfo.json" files in gamedata\mods\.
It then loops over all objects in the "assemblies" array inside of it, loading all dll paths (relative to the modInfo.json's location) if "enabled" is true.
Every type of the loaded assembly is checked if it has the attribute "ModLoader.ModManager" defined, which can be found in the Assembly-CSharp.dll library.
If it is defined, it checks all methods for one that has the ModCallback attribute.
Methods which define that attribute (with a value other than none) are added to a list internally.
This list is used later on at various moments to trigger these methods at certain points.

AfterAssemblyLoad 		- void () 		- Directly after all mod dll's are loaded. This is before most amount of the startup code has ran.
AfterStartup			- void () 		- At the end of the startup code, first after AfterAssembyLoad. Some thread loops are started, command line args are parsed but not used yet.
AfterSelectedWorld		- void () 		- At the start(-ish) of the loading world method, first after AfterStartup. ServerManager.WorldName is set, savegames/serverLock is created.
AfterItemTypesDefined	- void () 		- Slightly later in the loading world method, first after AfterSelectedWorld. The ItemTypes class is loaded.
AfterWorldLoad			- void () 		- After the world is fully loaded, first after AfterWorldLoad. All misc data is loaded (recipes, structures, npc's, player data, all that)
AfterNetworkSetup		- void () 		- After the NetworkWrapper class is loaded, first after AfterWorldLoad. Can take a few seconds for steam servers - it's after port forwarding etc is done on another thread.
OnUpdateStart			- void () 		- Start of Unity's Update loop, before anything is called (except for quitting mechanisms).
OnUpdate				- void () 		- Just after OnUpdateStart, after the ThreadManager did main thread delegates.
OnUpdateEnd				- void () 		- Just before the end of the update loop (after all relevant gamecode)
OnFixedUpdate			- void () 		- Unity's FixedUpdate loop
OnLateUpdate			- void () 		- Unity's LateUpdate loop (comes after Update and some unity internal things)
OnApplicationFocus		- void (bool a)	- Unity's OnApplicationFocus method.
OnApplicationPause		- void (bool b)	- Unity's OnApplicationPause method (probably unused, as the game does not have proper support for this, but hey here is an entry)

Most interesting mods will probably be based on using these game classes:

-ItemTypes.AddRawType				- Before "AfterItemTypesDefined", register a new type as if it's in types.json
-ChatCommands.CommandManager.RegisterCommand - To register chat commands for callbacks.
-ServerManager.TrySetBlock			- Change the blocktype at a certain position (includes sending to players, triggering OnChange callbacks on top of World.TrySetTypeAt + ServerManager.SendBlockChange)
-World.TryGetTypeAt					- Get the type at a certain position
-ItemTypesServer.RegisterType 		- For receiving callbacks for where certain blocks and placed/removed/changed/updated near and by who
-Pipliz.Chatting.Chat.Send			- To send chat messages to players
-Players.Send*						- Primary function to send data to all / some close by players.
-NetworkWrapper.Send*				- Primary function to send data to a specific players.
-Stockpile.GetStockPile				- Get the stockpile for fiddling
-UpdatableBlocks.BlockTracker		- Possible used for custom updatable/growable plants, check the other implementations
-PermissionsManager					- Check if someone has some permission
-Recipe*							- Classes with all crafting recipes & some helper functions to fiddle with them.
-General.Physics.Physics.CanSee 	- A method to see if source can see goal.
-BlockTypes.Builtin.BuiltinBlocks 	- Some builtin blocks (probably not exhaustive at the moment of writing, only usable after "AfterItemTypesDefined")
-AI.PathFinder(.TryFindPath)		- Class to try and find a path between A & B. Requires quite some care to work properly.
-TimeCycle							- Class that manages the ingame time (mostly just day & night, rest is Pipliz.Time)
-Pipliz.*							- Mostly helper classes that are not strictly tied to the game
-Pipliz.Time						- Tracks some times for cooldowns etc
-Pipliz.Log							- Multithreaded log writing, writes to both the UI log & the unity file log.
-Pipliz.Random						- Wrapper around System.Random to make it work with multiple threads (probably sort of slow)
-Pipliz.Math						- Who doesn't want their own math library (with the bugs that come with it)
-Pipliz.JSON						- Who doesn't want their own json library (with the bugs that come with it)
-Pipliz.ByteBuilder					- Class to write comfortably into a byte[] buffer without creating much more garbage than the final byte[] buffer.
-Pipliz.ByteReader 					- Class to read comfortably from a byte[] buffer
-Pipliz.Vector3Int					- Vector3 class using ints. Used for chunk positions, block position, other positions generally.
-Pipliz.Vector3Byte					- Vector3 class using sbytes. Mostly used for local chunk positions
-Pipliz.Threading.ThreadManager 	- Helper to queue delegates onto the main thread (possibly at a later interval) because 80%+ of the game isn't threadsafe.
-Pipliz.Threading.SpinLock			- A spinlock, with blackjack and hookers
-Pipliz.Collections.BinaryHeap  	- A binaryHeap. Not entirely sure why there is none in system.collections.generic
-Pipliz.Collections.ThreadSafe.*	- Mostly mediocre spinlock wrappers around other collections but does the job
-Pipliz.Noise						- Some noise functions (un)used (only OpenSimplexNoise is used)

Things that are probably too hard coded to be very useful at this moment:

-TerrainGenerator
-Most of the AI namespace.
-Most of the NPC namespace.
-Most of the jobs/areas (no namespace, FurnaceJob etc).
-Structures ?
-Filesaver class
-Colony class
-Chunk class

I apologize for the very inconsistent namespacing and general code quality. Part of the project is up to 2-3 years old, where I was even more of a beginner programmer.
I've gone through some phases & every phase thought "oh but this is the way it should be done", and suddenly every part of the game is written in a different style. But such is life at the beginning.
There's also random dead code / unused-semi-build features, because of shifting priorities.
